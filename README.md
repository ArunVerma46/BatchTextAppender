# BatchTextAppender

We have a folder containing 10 Notepad files, each with some pre-existing content.

As shown below, each file already contains some data before we apply our Python script.

We then use a simple Python script to loop through all .txt files and append a custom text to each of them.

After running the script, the custom text is successfully added to the end of every Notepad file.
